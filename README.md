FIXME: Set up for a a boiler plate for a MERN stack using Webpack

## How to start this app

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run schema`

## Database

This boilerplate will use MongoDB and Mongoose to store data. A template schema can be found in server/db/index.js. After the initial schema is created, the user will need to run the command `npm run build` in order to create your initial connection to the mongoose database.

### Back-end

- [ ] `name`, a unique string

### Front-end

Practicing with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). First project using the JSON server to generate dummy data rather than creating my own API in a database somewhere.
